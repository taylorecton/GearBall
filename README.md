# GearBall

This is a project created for my Artificial Intelligence class. The program is designed to model a gearball
puzzle using a basic text GUI. The program makes a number of random moves to the gearball in order to put it
into a random configuration and can then solve the puzzle using the A* search algorithm.

The solver works well up to solution depth of about 8. See the write up PDF for more details.
